# Open source 103 - Going open source

## GitHub guide

Maybe you already have a project you want to make open source right away? Once again, [Github has you covered](https://opensource.guide/starting-a-project/).

## Be nice
Sometimes people think that when they create an open source project, that contributors are their workers: they are not. They are volunteers, willing to spend their free time on your project.

The other way around the same thing happens: sometimes open source software users will demand you implement stuff they request: these people are not your boss. You are simply a/some nice person(s) providing them with cool stuff.

Keep these things in mind before making requests or asking for stuff. 

If you want to colaborate with others, you should always aim to be a pleasure to work with anyway (obviously).

## Read the rest
If your project is about to get big/if you want your project to become big; be sure to read the rest of the [GitHub guides](https://opensource.guide/)!
